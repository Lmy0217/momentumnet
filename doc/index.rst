Momentum ResNets
======

This is a library for using Momentum Residual Neural Networks [1].


Installation
------------

We recommend the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.
Otherwise, to install ``momentumnet``, you first need to install its dependencies::

	$ pip install numpy matplotlib torch

Then install Picard::

	$ pip install momentumnet

If you do not have admin privileges on the computer, use the ``--user`` flag
with `pip`. To upgrade, use the ``--upgrade`` flag provided by `pip`.

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

	$ python -c 'import momentumnet'

and it should not give any error message.
